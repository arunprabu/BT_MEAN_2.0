Routing Setup Instructions
===========================
    Registering Routes
    -----------------
Step 1: Create two components - namely home, products, 
Step 2: Create app.routing.ts inside app/ directory and add the following lines in it
        import { Routes, RouterModule } from "@angular/router";
        const APP_ROUTES: Routes = [
            { path: "", component: HomeComponent },
            { path: "products", component: ProductsComponent }
        ]

        //register the routes in built-in router module
        export const routing = RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES);

Step 3: In app.module.ts, 
        import { routing } from './app.routing';

        and add routing in 
            imports: [
                ..,
                ..,
                routing
            ]
Step 4: Show the corresponding component in the page. In app.component.html add the following line
        <router-outlet></router-outlet>

        REFRESH THE page,
        and navigate to, localhost:4200 and localhost:4200/products. pages should work fine.

Step 5: Now, in app.component.html page, add the following links
        <a [routerLink]="['']">Home</a>
        <a [routerLink]="['/products']">Products</a>

step 6: In product.component.html, 
        <button type="button" (click)="onGoHomeClick()">Go Home</button>

Step 7: Add a goto Home in products component
        open up, products.component.ts file, and add the following.
            
            import {Router} from '@angular/router'
            constructor(private router:Router ) { }

            onGoHomeClick(){
                this.router.navigate(['/']);
            }
